        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>
          Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise Connections Yacht
          Charters, are experienced sailors whose goal is to assist you in
          finding the best boat for your charter yacht sailing vacation.
        </p>
        <p class="p_content">
          Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while Sheila's only
          boating experience was riding a ferry a couple of times. We met, got
          married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a péniche (French
          barge) for a few years on the Seine river outside of Paris. This is
          where we got the boat-building bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a
          large project -- a 26-foot liveaboard sailboat. Within six months we
          were living aboard Loose Moose on the Marne river east of Paris.

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
          love love love... We are a bit different to other charter yacht
          brokers. The crew of Paradise Connections live in the Caribbean
          islands year round aboard our personal sail boat. We keep in touch
          with the boats and crews as they are our friends and neighbors.
